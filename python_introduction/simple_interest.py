# (I = P * R * T),
# Create a file named simple_interest.py.
# Define three variables in this file:
# principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
# rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
# time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
# Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
# Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].

principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

interest = principal * rate * time

print(f'he simple interest is: {interest}.')
